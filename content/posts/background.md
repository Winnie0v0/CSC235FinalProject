# Here is some background info:

Our system provides clues for people who are interested in finding connections about the abductions: As the “disappearance” incident happened at GAStech’s IPO’s celebration party, and the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected for the disappearance. This incident has drawn vast attention from the media and the public. The incident is such a mythical event that mystery story fans have presented passion in investigating the ground truth of this “disappearance” incident.
(The full background information can be found on VAST 2021 github, and we mainly target on investigating for mini challenge #2: https://vast-challenge.github.io/2021/MC2.html)

To help solve the mystery of the abduction, we decided to set up a website where people can freely interact and bounce ideas off of each other. The intended audience of our system is directed at mystery story fans who are active contributors to online discussions of different suspicious cases. In this case, we assume that they would love to participate in such a deciphering process. Therefore, they would like to see a platform where all collected evidence with nice data visualizations aiding these tools that we developed, they can try to decode where those missing people are and what happened to decode. Other intended audiences may be families of the missing people, the general public of Kronos, and the government officials of the city of Kronos, etc. At our disposal, we have a set of current and historical news reports from the 1900s to the day the abduction happened, geospatial data, credit card activity and loyalty card activity, as well as resumes of numerous GAStech employees and email headers from two weeks of internal GAStech company email.

Note: some graphs might takes sometimes to load.
